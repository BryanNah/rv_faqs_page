                <p>Yes, you can access the app on a different device as long as you remember your username and password
                    because they are required to access your farm information on the app.</p>

            <div class="panel">
                <p>Client data is the most precious thing we handle day-to-day. We use stronger encryption and password
                    requirements as well as transit encryption (SSL/TLS in the form of HTTPS) to secure usernames,
                    passwords and any other important data that is transmitted from your device to our server.</p>

                <p>Information you enter helps us organise your data in one place and create meaning out of it. Using
                    information you provide, our algorithms are able to assess your farm’s financial position and
                    provide collective data with pattern recognition to help you understand trends of your farming
                    activities.
